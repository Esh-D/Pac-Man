# Pac Man Game

## Description
A reinvented Pac Man game created in Java using Swing and Netbeans IDE. The user wins by eating all the yellow dots and they lose if one of the ghosts eats them. The game has a Main Menu, a Level Map where the user plays the game, and a Game Over and Winning Menu (depending on the players performance in the game, either menu will be shown). It is equipped with sound effects and a high score feature that displays your top 5 all-time highest scores each time you finish the game.
